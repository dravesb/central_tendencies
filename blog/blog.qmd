Welcome to my blog - Central Tendencies. 
The purpose of this blog is to share what I am [reading](reading/reading_scroll.qmd) and [working on](working_on/working_on_scroll.qmd). 
My interests center around machine learning (recommendation systems, causal machine learning), applied and theoretical statistics, and statistical pedagogy. 
See below to see about what I am currently up to.
