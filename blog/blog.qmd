I'm writing about two topics: 

* I am reading a series of classical papers in recommendation systems in preparation for a new team member joining. I'll be going through traditional papers on collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, learn-to-rank ideas, and modern DL applications.  
* I'm currently working my way through [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/ml-pytorch-book.htmla)  by Raschka, Lui, and Mirjalili to become more comfortable with PyTorch for multi-output models and GNNs for recommender applications. 
You can find my notes below.
