Welcome to my blog - Central Tendencies. 
My name is [Benjamin Draves](about.qmd) and I'm a [Senior Applied Scientist at Uber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-draves-347893167) in NYC. 
I'm interested in recommendation systems, causal machine learning, and statistics and tend to write about these topics. 
The purpose of Central Tendencies is to [share what I am reading about and working on](blog/blog.qmd) in hope of starting conversations with fellow data scientists and statisticians. 
If you wish to discuss what I'm working on, please feel free to reach out at [benjamin.draves@gmail.com](benjamin.draves@gmail.com).
