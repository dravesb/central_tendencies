My name is Benjamin Draves and I'm a Staff Applied Scientist at Uber in NYC. 
I work on building [ML systems](https://www.uber.com/blog/personalized-marketing-at-scale/?uclick_id=b3393989-abf6-452d-8aca-82b420fbb385) to grow Uber's consumer and earner businesses.

Before Uber, I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Boston University and wrote my [dissertation on spectral embedding methods for multiple network data](https://hdl.handle.net/2144/45235) and continue to study network science and matrix analysis methods. 
Outside of work, I enjoy distance running, soccer, reading, and exploring NYC.
